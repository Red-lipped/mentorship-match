# Mentorship Match

We are solving the issue of not having a professional network specific to STEM fields. There may be platforms out there to connect with professionals, but not necessarily surrounding the themes of mentorship and networking in STEM. 

We bring a platform in order to give users the opportunity to become mentors, or be a mentee, with STEM professionals. We allow you to specify your STEM field of interest in order to connect with professionals and students.
